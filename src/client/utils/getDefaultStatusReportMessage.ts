        I've been using the Trac app to track how frequently I am completing practice for a habit I'm calling "${habit.name}". I am practicing it in order to accomplish my goal called "${milestone.name}". I would like to send you a quick report of how it's been going:
        
            STATUS REPORT ðŸ“ˆ
        ${statusReportString} 

Thank you for helping to keep me accountable and motivated! I'll be sending another status report soon.


Onward and upward,
${username}`
